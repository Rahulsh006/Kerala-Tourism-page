            <h2 style="color: #4E9F3D;">MUNNAR</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Set at an altitude of 6000 ft in Idukki district, Munnar was the favored summer resort of the erstwhile British rulers in the colonial days. Unending expanse of tea plantations ­ pristine valleys and mountains­ exotic species of flora and fauna in its wild sanctuaries and forests ­ aroma of spice scented cool air ­ yes! This beautiful destination has all these and more. It's the place you would love to visit ­ it's the place you would wish never to leave. Munnar is such a beautiful place in Kerala, which cannot be portrayed in a single canvas. Everything and anything here will make us excited. The hills, the mist, the valleys, the streams, the waterfalls, tea plantations, rare flora and fauna.... It is a beautiful tea town in Idukki district of Kerala easily accessible from Kochi and Coimbatore. The gorgeous hill station is ideally placed in the South Western Ghats of India. With an area of around 557 sq km, Munnar in Devikulam Taluk is the largest panchayat in Kerala. Munnar got its name from its strategic location at the confluence of three rivers – Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala Rivers. 'Moonu' means 'three' and 'Aru' means 'river'. The region is placed at a height of around 1,500 m to 2,695 m above sea level and was once the summer capital of the British in South India. Later it was developed for cultivating tea plants. The beautiful sights of acres and acres of lush green tea plantations will make us realize that we have at last reached Munnar and of course the place is so much known for its tea estates. It always carries the remnants of history of tea cultivation in Kerala. Neelakurinji or Strobilanthus has special status in the tourism map of this fascinating destination. The flower which blooms once in twelve years attracts lots of tourists from all over the world.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #4E9F3D;">IDUKKI ARCH DAM</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The idea of a hydroelectric project over the Periyar River occurred to W H John, the then superintendent of Malankara Estate. John, in an article published in Malayala Manorama daily in 1935, detailed the prospects of such a project. Kuravan and Kurathi hills, the core area of the project, were introduced to John by Chemban Kolumban, a member of the local Oorali tribe. Kolumban with his wide knowledge of the forest later became an accomplice of the engineers who came for site inspection. As a token of appreciation for Kolumban’s services, the KSEB later allowed a monthly pension of Rs. 40 to Kolumban. There also stands a memorial to Kolumban on the dam site. In 1937, two Italian engineers submitted a project proposal for a 50,000 KW hydroelectric project on Periyar River to the Government of Travancore. It was followed by a site visit by a team led by Electricity Chief Engineer of Travancore Government Joseph John in 1947. In 1956, the Government of India began the site investigation of the project, which was completed in 1961. The project work was started in 1963 and the first phase was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi in 1976.</p>
            <p>The Idukki reservoir with a capacity of 2 billion tons is formed by two rivers Periyar and Cheruthoni. Water is held in the reservoir with the help of three dams – Idukki, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu. While the Idukki dam is meant for storing the water, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu, which are built at a lower portion of the reservoir, channel the water to the powerhouse. Power is generated at an underground station situated at Moolamattam. </p>

            <h2 style="color: #4E9F3D;">PANCHALIMEDU HILLS</h2>
            <br>
            <p>One of the most exquisite hill stations in the Idukki district of Kerala, Panchalimedu provides an unearthly atmosphere with its speciality being the cold climate and refreshing breeze. The place is surrounded by a captivating set of hills which refreshes the mind and body of its visitors. If legends are to be believed, then the Pandavas came here and stayed at this place during the period of their exile which is how the place got its name. One of the caves here also bears the footprints of Bhima and a small pond known as Panjali Kulam situated here is the place where the wife of the Pandavas i.e. Panchali used to take bath.</p>
