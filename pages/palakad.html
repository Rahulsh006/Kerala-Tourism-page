                    <p class="center-text">Palakkad is supposed to have derived its name from the “Pala tree” (Alsteria Scholaris) and “kadu” (forest). Palakkad, due to its geographical position, has a strategic role in Kerala. Before the commissioning of Konkan Railway along the Western coast, Palakkad was the gateway to Kerala from the country.The 32 to 40 km gap in the 960km Western Ghats functions as an inlet for northeast monsoon and dry winds. N H 47, a major artillery of Kerala, passes through this Ghat section.The whole area is said to have been once covered by pala trees.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">Thrissur is from where Kerala gets a fair share of its festive glitter. Thrissur was the capital of the Kingdom of Kochi. The festivals celebrated here are the major attraction for tourists and a visit to Thrissur is incomplete without witnessing these. Other tourist spots in Thrissur include the Vadakkumnathan Kshetram Temple, Tomb of Shakthan Thampuran, Archaeology Museum, Athirapally Falls, Heritage Garden and many more.</p>

To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy. The Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice option as a picnic place. As the Ghat road winds its way up to Nelliyampathy, at certain places there are viewpoints from where the vast stretches of Palakkad district are visible with its extensive paddy fields forming a verdant carpet. It also offers a splendid view of the Palakkad Gap, which is a geographical phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in this region, bringing into view, parts of the adjoining State of Tamil Nadu. On the way up, those interested in bio farming can take a close look at the privately managed farms and also vast expanses of tea estates managed by different plantation companies. The hills of Nelliyampathy are also well known for its orange cultivation.</p>
            <p class="center-text">Privately owned hotels and resorts are located at various points, as one goes up the hills of Nelliyampathy. The bio-farms located here are a major landmark as one proceeds up before reaching the topmost point at Palagapandi Estate. </p>
