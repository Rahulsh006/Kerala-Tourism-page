                    <p class="center-text">Officially known as the cultural capital of Kerala, Thrissur is famous for fostering classical Keralan performing arts, religious sites and the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival, Onam festival and Vadakkumnathan Temple. Thrissur is the short form of Thiru-Shiva-Per-Ur which literally means “a city with three temples of Lord Shiva”. Thrissur later became anglicised to Trichur.

                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text">Thrissur is from where Kerala gets a fair share of its festive glitter. Thrissur was the capital of the Kingdom of Kochi. The festivals celebrated here are the major attraction for tourists and a visit to Thrissur is incomplete without witnessing these. Other tourist spots in Thrissur include the Vadakkumnathan Kshetram Temple, Tomb of Shakthan Thampuran, Archaeology Museum, Athirapally Falls, Heritage Garden and many more.</p>

The temple is also known as Thenkailasam or Vrishabhachalam.The temple is built in typical Kerala style architecture, located on a hillock in the heart of Thrissur city.

There are 4 gateways called gopurams to the temple facing East, West, North and South respectively.</p>
            <p>The temple is known for the rare murals portrayed here that include scenes from Mahabharatha, of which Vasukishayana and Nrithanatha are worshipped daily. Apart from these murals, the temple also houses a museum that showcases ancient paintings, woodcarving and other works of art of ancient times.The Koothambalam of the temple, or the temple theatre, is rich in its display of wooden carved vignettes. Koothambalam is used for staging ritualistic art forms of Central Kerala like Koothu, Koodiyattam and Nangyar Koothu. The three main shrines in this temple are of Sri Vadakkunnathan (Lord Shiva), Lord Shankaranarayana and Lord Rama. Goddess Parvati is also worshipped here. One for the strange aspects of the temple is that the ghee offered here for centuries doesn't melt, even in scorching summers.
